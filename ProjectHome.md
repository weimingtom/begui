# Introduction #

<p>BeGUI (pronounced bee-gui) is an OpenGL-based user interface library. It is intended to provide the most common user interface components and a unifying environment for their deployment. However, it is not built as a complete framework, like MFC for example. Instead, it is meant to provide classes that can be taken individualy and thrown into an already existing project to provide GUI functionality. This means that its design is decentralized, and it does not define or need any specific program organization. It provides, however, some <em>optional</em> foundation classes for faster application development.</p>

<p>The main motive behind this project was to provide a more appealing, simpler and easier to use alternative to APIs like GLUI, having a modern cross-platform look 'n feel, and making all API features easily accessible to the programmer (without having to search the manuals for hours).</p>
